Hardware modes are not implented
PLEASE UPDATE YOUR BIOS IF YOU HAVE ISSUES WITH HARDWARE MODES AFTER CLOSING OPENRGB

If you have other models beside the Legion 7 gen 6 and want to test if RGB can be added to OpenRGB,
you can do so if you're on Windows by running
[this Powershell script](https://gitlab.com/pvazny/legion7-rgb-ps) with the `-test` parameter:

```powershell
legion7-rgb.ps1 -test -v 0x048D -p 0xC935 -up 0xFF89 -u 0x07 -c 0xa1 -start 0x15 -stop 0xa1
```

This script will iterate through each LED one by one, in bank `$c = 0xa1`, between IDs
`-start 0x15` and `-stop 0xa1`, on the HID device with VID `-v 0x048D` PID `-p 0xC935` usage page
`-up 0xFF89` and usage `-u 0x07`. It will default to the Legion 7 Gen 6 description, however you can
enter a new description for each LED and at the end it will generate the differences.

To check if you have an eligible HID device that could potentially be iterated by the script please
open the powershell command prompt and executre the follow:

```powershell
Get-PnpDevice -Class 'HIDClass' | ForEach-Object { [PSCustomObject]@{Name = $_.FriendlyName; InstanceId = $_.InstanceId; HardwareId = ($_.HardwareId | Where-Object {$_ -like 'HID_DEVICE_UP:*' })}} | Where-Object { $_.HardwareId -ne $null } | Sort-Object InstanceId
```

If the script is successful please create a [new device issue](https://gitlab.com/CalcProgrammer1/OpenRGB/-/issues/new?issuable_template=New%20Device#)
and attach the relevant details to request support for your device."

Get-PnpDevice -Class 'HIDClass' | ForEach-Object { [PSCustomObject]@{Name = $_.FriendlyName; InstanceId = $_.InstanceId; HardwareId = ($_.HardwareId | Where-Object {$_ -like 'HID_DEVICE_UP:*' })}} | Where-Object { $_.HardwareId -ne $null } | Sort-Object InstanceId
```

If the script is successful please create a [new device issue](https://gitlab.com/CalcProgrammer1/OpenRGB/-/issues/new?issuable_template=New%20Device#)
and attach the relevant details to request support for your device."
"Lenovo USB","Keyboard","USB","Lenovo Legion 7S gen 6","048D","C967","","","❌","✔️","❌","Tested on Lenovo Legion 7/7i gen. 6 ANSI and ISO models
Hardware modes are not implented
PLEASE UPDATE YOUR BIOS IF YOU HAVE ISSUES WITH HARDWARE MODES AFTER CLOSING OPENRGB

If you have other models beside the Legion 7 gen 6 and want to test if RGB can be added to OpenRGB,
you can do so if you're on Windows by running
[this Powershell script](https://gitlab.com/pvazny/legion7-rgb-ps) with the `-test` parameter:

```powershell
legion7-rgb.ps1 -test -v 0x048D -p 0xC935 -up 0xFF89 -u 0x07 -c 0xa1 -start 0x15 -stop 0xa1
```

This script will iterate through each LED one by one, in bank `$c = 0xa1`, between IDs
`-start 0x15` and `-stop 0xa1`, on the HID device with VID `-v 0x048D` PID `-p 0xC935` usage page
`-up 0xFF89` and usage `-u 0x07`. It will default to the Legion 7 Gen 6 description, however you can
enter a new description for each LED and at the end it will generate the differences.

To check if you have an eligible HID device that could potentially be iterated by the script please
open the powershell command prompt and executre the follow:

```powershell
Get-PnpDevice -Class 'HIDClass' | ForEach-Object { [PSCustomObject]@{Name = $_.FriendlyName; InstanceId = $_.InstanceId; HardwareId = ($_.HardwareId | Where-Object {$_ -like 'HID_DEVICE_UP:*' })}} | Where-Object { $_.HardwareId -ne $null } | Sort-Object InstanceId
```

If the script is successful please create a [new device issue](https://gitlab.com/CalcProgrammer1/OpenRGB/-/issues/new?issuable_template=New%20Device#)
and attach the relevant details to request support for your device."
